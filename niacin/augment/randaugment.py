class RandAugment:
    """Implements RandAugment algorithm (randaugment_) as an iterator.
    RandAugment selects ``n`` functions at random from a sequence, and
    initializes them with magnitude ``m``.

    To use it, initialize this class with a list of transformation functions.
    Every time it is iterated over (e.g. in a for loop) it yields a random
    subset of those transformation functions.

    The original paper claims that m is on a scale from 0-10, but its listed
    experiments regularly use magnitudes in the 20s and 30s. We take this to
    mean that "10" was a typo, and the scale was meant to extend to 100.

    The defaults for m and n have been set to 1 and 10, respectively, for
    safety. Depending on your model size and task, you may achieve more
    accurate results with n âˆˆ {2, 3} and an m in the range [10, 20). By
    default, the transforms in a single sample will be returned in random
    order. If your transforms must occur in a logical sequence (e.g. swapping
    synonyms before removing random characters), set shuffle to False.

    Args:
        transforms: sequence of transformation functions
        m: magnitude of transformation, on a scale of 0-100
        n: number of transforms to select
        shuffle: return transforms in random order
        seed: seed to use for the random number generator
